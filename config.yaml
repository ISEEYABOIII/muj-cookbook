# If you maintain your recipes in a GitHub repository, you can specify its URL
# here – if non-empty, an "Edit" link will be shown at the bottom of each recipe
# page, referring you to the corresponding Markdown file on GitHub. If you've
# got some sort of continous integration (like the included GitHub Action) set
# up, this effectively turns your site into a wiki.

# it's correct – the path in particular – since otherwise stuff that shouldn't
# be deleted or overwritten might indeed be deleted or overwritten!
